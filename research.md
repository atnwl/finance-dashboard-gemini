# Market Research: Building & Property Management Platforms

## Executive Summary
The "Building Management" software market is split into two distinct categories that often overlap in conversation but serve different needs:
1.  **Property Management Software (PMS)**: Focuses on the business side—tenants, leases, accounting, and marketing ("Selling" & "Managing").
2.  **Building Management Systems (BMS)**: Focuses on the physical hardware—HVAC, energy, security, and access control ("Operating").

To answer your request about features that drive 80% of the results, we analyzed the market leaders in both spaces.

## 2. The "20%" Feature Set (The 80/20 Rule)
While these platforms offer hundreds of features, the "vast majority of results" (Revenue, Efficiency, Tenant Satisfaction) come from just these core capabilities.

### For Property Management (PMS)
If you build nothing else, you must build these. They account for the daily workflow of 80% of users.

#### A. Financial Core (The "Bank")
*The absolute critical path. If this fails, the software is useless.*
*   **Rent Collection & Payments**: Automated ACH/Credit card processing. This is the #1 value driver—getting paid faster.
*   **General Ledger Accounting**: Trust accounting, automatic reconciliation, and owner statements.
*   **Late Fee Automation**: purely profit-driven feature that requires zero effort once set up.

#### B. The "Selling" Engine (Leasing)
*   **Syndicated Listings**: One-click publishing of vacancies to Zillow, Apartments.com, etc.
*   **Online Applications & Screening**: Instant credit/background checks. Speed kills deals; instant results close leases.
*   **eSign Leases**: Removing physical paper speeds up occupancy by days or weeks.

#### C. Maintenance Triage (The "Builder" aspect)
*   **Work Order Management**: Tenants submit photos/requests -> Auto-assign to vendor -> Vendor updates status.
*   **Vendor Portals**: Automated invoicing from contractors.

### For Building Automation (BMS)
#### A. Energy Optimization
*   **Automated Scheduling**: Turning off HVAC/lights when rooms are empty. This single feature drives the ROI for the entire system.
*   **Peak Load Shedding**: Reducing power during expensive hours.

#### B. Alarm Management
*   **Critical Alerts**: "The boiler is down" or "Security breach."

## 3. What They Have In Common (Success Factors)
1.  **The "Single Source of Truth" Database**: Whether it's tenant data or temperature sensors, successful platforms stop users from using Excel. They become the database of record.
2.  **Portals for Everyone**: They don't just face the manager. They have:
    *   **Tenant Portal**: Pay rent, complain.
    *   **Owner Portal**: See financial reports (Keep investors happy).
    *   **Vendor Portal**: Get work orders.
3.  **Mobile First**: Property managers are rarely valid at a desk. The mobile app experience determines retention.
4.  **Ecosystem Integrations**: They don't try to build *everything* (e.g., they integrate with Gmail/Outlook, QuickBooks, or banks rather than rebuilding email or banking).

## Summary: The MVP for "Selling, Building, Managing"
To capture the majority of value, a platform needs:
1.  **Sell**: Automatic listing syndication + Instant Tenant Screening.
2.  **Build/Maintain**: Mobile Work Orders (Photo upload -> Assign to Vendor).
3.  **Manage**: Automated Rent Collection + Legal Trust Accounting.
